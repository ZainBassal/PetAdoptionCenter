        <h2>How to take care of your cat: </h2>
        <p>Taking care of a cat involves providing a balanced diet, fresh water, and a clean litter box. Regular veterinary check-ups, vaccinations, and parasite prevention help maintain their health. Cats need mental and physical stimulation through play, scratching posts, and interactive toys. Grooming, especially for long-haired breeds, prevents matting and hairballs. Ensuring a safe environment, social interaction, and a comfortable resting area helps keep them happy and stress-free.</p>
