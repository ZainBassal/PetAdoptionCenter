            <p>Taking care of a dog involves providing proper nutrition, fresh water, regular exercise, 
               and routine veterinary check-ups to keep them healthy. Grooming, including brushing and bathing, 
               helps maintain their coat and skin. Training and socialization are essential for good behavior 
               and mental stimulation. Ensuring a safe environment, regular playtime, and affection strengthen 
               the bond between owner and pet. Lastly, keeping up with vaccinations, parasite control, 
               and regular health monitoring ensures a long, happy life for the dog.</p>
